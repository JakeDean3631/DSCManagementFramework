# <u>MOFs Folder</u> 
> No Manual Editing

The MOFs folder will be used to store the dynamically generated MOF files.  These files will persist until the next run of the <b>Build.ps1</b> script.  If a Build.ps1 run fails to generate MOF files this folder will remain empty until there is a succesful run.
