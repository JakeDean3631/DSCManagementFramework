# <u>Artifacts Folder</u>
> No Manual Editing

The Artifacts folder is used to store the dynamically generated <b>configurationData.psd1</b> file and the node specific configuration files.  Manual review of these files should be helpful with troubleshooting.  These files are created on each run of the <b>Build.ps1</b> script.
