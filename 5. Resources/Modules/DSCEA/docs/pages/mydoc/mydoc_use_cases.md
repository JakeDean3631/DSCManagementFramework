## Overview

DSCEA's primary use case is to verify that your systems are actually configured the way you want them to be.  

## Use Case Examples

Real world examples of how DSCEA can be used include

* Verify a single setting, for example if a registry key is set appropriately across your entire environment - [Link to blog post](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/ralphkyttle/2017/03/21/introducing-dscea/)
* Audit your systems to ensure that they meet the base level system configuration settings that are required to be a part of your environment
* Scan the systems in your environment against all of the items that make up your organization's security baseline
* Verify that settings configured via Group Policy are being applied correctly to the systems in your environment
* Verify settings configured on Windows Server 2016 Nano servers (which do not support Group Policy)
