      <RawString>1. Interview the IAM or site representative and obtain the list of accounts that have been delegated AD object ownership or update permissions and that are not members of Windows built-in administrative groups.
(This includes accounts for help desk or support personnel who are not Administrators, but have authority in AD to maintain user accounts or printers.)

2. If accounts with delegated authority are defined and there is no list, then this is a finding.

3. Count the number of accounts on the list.

4. If the number of accounts with delegated authority is greater than 10, review the site documentation that justifies this number.  Validate that the IAM explicitly acknowledges the need to have a high number of privileged users.

5. If the number of accounts with delegated authority is greater than 10 and there is no statement in the documentation that justifies the number, then this is a finding.</RawString>

4. Verify that it has been determined by the IAM whether INFOCON response actions need to include procedures to disable manual AD trusts (cross-directory configurations). The objective is to determine if the need has been explicitly evaluated.

5. If it has been determined that actions to disable manual AD trusts (cross-directory configurations) are not necessary, then this check is not applicable.

6. If it has been determined that actions to disable manual AD trusts (cross-directory configurations) *are* necessary, verify that the policy to implement these actions has been documented.

Microsoft's Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) provides an automated solution for maintaining and regularly changing a local administrator password for domain-joined systems. LAPS can manage a single local administrator account. The default is the built-in administrator account however it can be configured to manage an administrator account of a different name. If additional local administrator accounts exist across systems, the organization must have a process to require unique passwords on each system for the additional accounts.

Other automated solutions that provide this capability may also be used.

If LAPS has been installed and enabled in the domain, the following PowerShell query will return a list of systems that do not have a local administrator password managed by LAPS. (The LAPS PowerShell module requires PowerShell 2.0 or higher and .NET Framework 4.0.)

Open "Windows PowerShell".
If the LAPS PowerShell module has not been previously imported, execute the following first: "Import-Module AdmPwd.ps".
Execute "Get-AdmPwdPassword -ComputerName * | Where-object {$_.password -eq $null}"

Review the returned list for validity.

Exclude computers with "OU=Domain Controllers" in the DistinguishedName field.  Other possible exceptions include but are not limited to non-Windows computers in Active Directory.

If any active/deployed Windows systems that are not managed by another process to ensure unique passwords for local administrator accounts are listed, this is a finding.

If the query fails, the organization must demonstrate that passwords for local administrator accounts are properly managed to ensure unique passwords for each.  If not, this is a finding.</RawString>

      <RawString>Windows Server 2016 with a domain functional level of Windows Server 2016:

Open "Active Directory Administrative Center".

Right-click on the domain name and select "Properties".

If the "Domain functional level:" is not "Windows Server 2016", another method must be used to reset the NT hashes.  See below for other options.

If the "Domain functional level:" is "Windows Server 2016" and "Enable rolling of expiring NTLM secrets during sign on, for users who are required to use Microsoft Passport or smart card for interactive sign on" is not checked, this is a finding.

Active Directory domains with a domain functional level below Windows Server 2016:

Verify the organization rotates the NT hash for smart card-enforced accounts every 60 days.

This can be accomplished with the use of scripts.

DoD PKI-PKE has provided a script under PKI and PKE Tools at http://iase.disa.mil/pki-pke/Pages/tools.aspx.  See the User Guide for additional information.

NSA has also provided a PowerShell script with Pass-the-Hash guidance at https://github.com/iadgov/Pass-the-Hash-Guidance.  Running the "Invoke-SmartcardHashRefresh" cmdlet in the "PtHTools" module will trigger a change of the underlying NT hash.  See the site for additional information.

Manually rolling the NT hash requires disabling and re-enabling the "Smart Card required for interactive logon" option for each smart card-enforced account, which is not practical for large groups of users.

If NT hashes for smart card-enforced accounts are not rotated every 60 days, this is a finding.</RawString>

      <RawString>If the domain functional level is not at least Windows 2012 R2, this is NA.

Open "Windows PowerShell".

Enter "Get-ADDomain | FL DomainMode" to determine the domain functional level.

Open "Active Directory Users and Computers" (available from various menus or run "dsa.msc").

Compare membership of the Protected Users group to membership of the following groups. By default, the groups are under the node referenced; however, it is possible to move those under "Users" to another location.
Enterprise Admins (Users node)
Domain Admins (Users node)
Schema Admins (Users node)
Administrators (Builtin node)
Account Operators (Builtin node)
Backup Operators (Builtin node)

It is recommended that one account be excluded to ensure availability if there are issues with Kerberos.

Excluding the account left out for availability, if all user accounts from the local domain that are members of the domain level groups above are not also members of the Protected Users group, this is a finding. (User accounts is referring to accounts for personnel, not service accounts.)</RawString>
