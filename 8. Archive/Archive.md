# <u>Archive Folder</u>
> No Manual Editing

The Archive folder is used to store the ZIP files that are created after the MOF files have been successfully generated. These ZIP files should routinely be removed and as part of a continuous delivery (CD) model these should be pushed to a pull server or directly to the servers that are being updated.
